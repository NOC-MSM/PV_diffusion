by 

V.O. Ivchenko and B. Sinha

Figure 1 was plotted using the FERRET package (https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/) with some additional processing done using fortran

Ferret .jnl files used are in subdirectory ferret_jnls along with the fortran programs (.f files)

Plot data was generated by the Fine Resolution (FR) model

The data for these plots are stored in directory FR_model_output which has its own README file
