This directory is an archive of the FR model simulations used in this paper

each simulation has a 3 digit identifier (e.g. 003)

there are three netcdf format files (filenames ending .topog.nc, .phi.nc and .eng.nc) 
and two ascii format files (filenames ending .params and .output) for each simulation

the netcdf files contain model output variables (such as streamfunction, kinetic energy etc) and are self describing

the ascii format files contain information about the model run (model parameters such as channel length, max windstress etc
and run parameters such as number of timesteps and output frequency)
