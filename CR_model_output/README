generated by the CR model - see the corresponding Ferret plotting jnl files in directory Ferret_jnls 
one level above this directory

all files have 40000 lines corresponding to the horisontal resolution of the CR model (400x100 gridpoints
with 400 in the x-direction and 100 in the y-direction with a gridpoint spaceing of 10km)

the data are in ascii format, one value per line with the the southern most row of 400 values first
then the 400 values 1 gridpoint to the north and so on
